## 🛠️ Features
- 🚥 Simulates real-world traffic light behavior (Green → Yellow → Red)
- ⏱️ Adjustable timing intervals for each light
- 🔄 Automatic loop cycle
- 🧹 Clean and efficient code structure
- 🔌 Low power consumption (thanks to ESP32-S2 capabilities)

---

## 🧰 Requirements
- ESP32-S2 development board
- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- 3 resistors (220Ω recommended)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Micro-USB cable for programming
